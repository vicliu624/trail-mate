# NOTICE

## About This Project

**Trail-mate** is an offline-first field communication and situational-awareness system built around low-power radio devices (LoRa and compatible sub-GHz radios).
The project focuses on reliable human-to-human coordination in environments where cellular networks are unavailable, unstable, or undesirable.

This repository is an actively developed engineering project, not an abandoned code drop and not a code archive.

If you are evaluating, integrating, porting, modifying, or using this codebase in any product, research, deployment, or internal tooling — you are encouraged to contact the author.
