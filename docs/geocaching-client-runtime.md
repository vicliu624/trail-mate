# Geocaching client runtime

Device discovery and browsing use a disposable RAM session. Opening Discover,
checking directory capabilities, querying, refreshing and paging do not open SD
storage or recover previous queries. A response is displayed after the existing
transport authentication and query validation; no journal commit is required.

`LiveQueryPort` owns one request, one page and two response fingerprints. Its
object size is capped at 3 KiB, excluding the query client and transport stack.
An accepted transport submission retries the same request after 15 seconds;
a rejected submission retries after one second. The query client's existing
120-second deadline cancels further sends. Closing abandons the RAM request.
Exact accepted duplicates can be acknowledged without disk access.

Storage starts when the user opens Downloaded or Published, or saves a cache.
Downloads and publications retain signature checks, durable transaction state,
verified GPX installation, restart recovery and durable reply receipts. Storage
failure or USB ownership does not prevent Discover from receiving a page.
Checkpoint rotation shares storage ownership with persistent operations but
does not delay network queries or pagination.

Legacy kind-3 browse tasks remain readable on existing cards. The indexed
dispatcher skips them without a startup scan that rewrites each task. Older
query storage adapters are retained for storage-format compatibility tests;
the device runtime no longer instantiates them.

Host verification uses the production runtime with simulated transport, SD and
clock: absent SD, USB ownership, busy sends, bounded retries, exact duplicate
checks, pagination during maintenance, saved downloads, publication updates,
index corruption, interrupted recovery and checkpoint reclamation. These checks
do not establish ESP peak heap usage or real network latency.
